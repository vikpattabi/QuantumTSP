# QuantumTSP
Implementation of a Traveling Salesman solver using a Quantum Virtual Machine
\
\
Final Project for Stanford's CS269Q: 'Quantum Computer Programming' 
\
# Installation Notes
Required packages include Python 3.7, pyQuil, networkx, matplotlib, and numpy. Installing pyQuil and running a QVM instance as described in the CS269Q pyQuil guide should be sufficient for running this project.
\
# How to use this Project
This project features a number of files designed to implement a Quantum Phase Estimation approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. The core file is __solver.py__ which implements functions from __tsp_funcs.py__ and __quantum_funcs.py__. Another file, __data.py__, allows the user to visualize saves networks and randomly generate new (already normalized) networks on which to test.
